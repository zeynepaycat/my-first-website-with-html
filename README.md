# my-first-website-with-html
This project is my homework for web technologies class.

    This is a webpage that briefly describes me and writes about my hobbies. I wanted it to be a colorful webpage and I designed it accordingly. I added a landscape image.

    There is a link which shold go to my blog when user click. I added borders to  paragraph and heading.
